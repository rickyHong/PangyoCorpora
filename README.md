## Overview

**Pangyo Corpora** is a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their multi-language learning capabilities. This repository provides a diverse and comprehensive dataset curated specifically for the purpose of training Language Models (LLMs) to handle code-switching and multi-language contexts effectively.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of a wide range of code-switching examples, allowing LLMs to grasp the nuances of switching between languages within a single conversation or text. Pangyo Corpora covers a multitude of languages and domains, making it an ideal resource for developing LLMs with multi-language proficiency.

## Features

- **Multilingual Diversity**: Pangyo Corpora includes examples from various languages and language pairs, enabling LLMs to understand and generate content in multiple languages.

## Contribute

- If you have additional code-switching examples or improvements to share, we welcome contributions to enhance the dataset for the community.
